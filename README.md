# Development Tips


- Please only make changes to the `source` and `locales` folder


- Live reload is enabled. So whenever you make changes in the code editor, the browser automatically refreshes itself


- Texts & links belong in the YAML file in the locales folder


The SASS stylesheets in the `app` folder need to begin with an underscore for the build to work



# Build


- Execute `middleman build` to create static files in the build folder


- For troubleshooting, try `middleman build --verbose` to see error messages
